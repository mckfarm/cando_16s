# CANDO+P reactor - 16s rRNA analysis
This repo summarizes the workflow and scripts for analyzing 16s rRNA sequence data from the lab-scale CANDO+P reactor. DNA was extracted from reactor biomass and sequenced at the Rush Genomics Core and Microbiome Core Facility.

16s rRNA PCR was performed with two different primer sets to compare the taxonomic results. The V1/V3 workflow uses the primers 27F/534R primers as recommended by (MiDAS version 4)[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.06.451231v1].

The V4/V5 workflow uses the primers 515F/926R as recommended in (Parada et al 2016)[https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1462-2920.13023].
